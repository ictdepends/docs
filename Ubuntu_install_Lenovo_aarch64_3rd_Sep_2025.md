First download 'Ubuntu Server', as there isn't yet an official Desktop for Snapdragon X Elite laptops.

After installation, log in and run:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop -y
```
## Download

Downloaded 25.04 as it is best for my modern pc, LTS version may not work correctly.

Insert flash drive into machine, it reads a E.

Open BalenaEtcher.

Click on 'Flash from file', select ubuntu-25.04-live-server-arm64.iso from File Explorer, click open.

Click 'Select target' on balenaEtcher
